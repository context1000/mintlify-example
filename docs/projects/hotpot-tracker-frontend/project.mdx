# Hotpot Tracker - Team Task Management Platform

## Project Overview

Hotpot Tracker is a collaborative task management platform built for teams that need real-time coordination and structured workflows. It combines the flexibility of Kanban boards with team-based permissions and real-time collaboration features.

## Architecture Summary

### Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 18 SPA with TypeScript
- **UI Library**: Chakra UI with dark/light theme support
- **Backend**: InstantDB (Backend-as-a-Service)
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side routing)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with TypeScript
- **Authentication**: Magic link via InstantDB
- **Real-time**: InstantDB real-time subscriptions


## Core Features

### 1. Team Management

- Multi-tenant architecture with team-based isolation
- Team invitations and membership management
- Role-based access control
- Team settings and configuration

### 2. Board & Column System

- Kanban-style boards for visual task organization
- Customizable columns with approval rules
- Drag-and-drop task management
- Board-level smart parameters

### 3. Task Management

- Rich text task descriptions with TipTap editor
- Task assignment and approval workflows
- Issue tracking and discussion threads
- Task history and event logging

### 4. Real-time Collaboration

- Live updates across team members
- Real-time cursor tracking
- Collaborative editing capabilities
- Presence indicators

### 5. AI Integration

- AI-powered task analysis and reporting
- Smart parameter extraction
- Intelligent task categorization

## Data Model

### Core Entities

```
Users ($users) → Memberships → Teams
    ↓
Teams → Boards → Columns → Tasks
    ↓         ↓
Statuses  SmartParams
    ↓
Events (audit log)

Tasks → Issues → Replies
```

### Key Relationships

- **Team-centric**: All data belongs to a team for proper multi-tenancy
- **Hierarchical**: Teams > Boards > Columns > Tasks
- **Audit Trail**: Events track all significant actions
- **Discussion**: Issues and replies provide task-level communication

## Development Workflow

### 1. Local Development

```bash
npm run dev              # Start development server
npm run type-check       # TypeScript validation
npm run lint             # ESLint checking
npm run format           # Prettier formatting
```

### 2. InstantDB Integration

```bash
npm run instant:login    # Authenticate with InstantDB
npm run instant:push     # Deploy schema and permissions
npm run instant:pull     # Sync remote changes
```

### 3. Build and Deploy

```bash
npm run build           # Production build
npm run preview         # Preview production build
```

## Security & Permissions

### Multi-tenancy

- All operations scoped to team membership
- Team-based data isolation in all queries
- Automatic team filtering in database layer

### Authentication

- Magic link authentication (no passwords)
- JWT tokens managed by InstantDB
- Automatic session management

### Authorization

- Team membership required for all operations
- Feature-level permissions (create, read, update, delete)
- Role-based access control for team management

## Performance Considerations

### Database Optimization

- Indexed fields for frequent queries (`teamId`, `createdAt`, etc.)
- Soft deletes to maintain data integrity
- Efficient relationship modeling

### Frontend Optimization

- Code splitting with lazy loading
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- Bundle optimization with Vite

### Real-time Features

- Selective subscriptions to reduce bandwidth
- Debounced updates for high-frequency operations
- Efficient state management with InstantDB

## Monitoring & Error Handling

### Error Tracking

- Sentry integration for production error monitoring
- Global error boundaries for graceful failure handling
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

### Performance Monitoring

- Vercel Speed Insights integration
- Real-time performance metrics
- User experience monitoring

## Future Roadmap

### Planned Features

- Mobile app support (React Native)
- Advanced reporting and analytics
- Integration with external tools (GitHub, Slack)
- Advanced AI features (task automation)
- Custom field types and forms

### Technical Improvements

- Enhanced offline support
- Performance optimization
- Accessibility improvements
- Advanced testing coverage
