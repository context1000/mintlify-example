# Feature-Based Folder Structure

## Context

The Hotpot Tracker frontend requires a scalable folder organization that supports:

- Clear separation between different feature domains (boards, tasks, teams, auth)
- Easy navigation for developers working on specific features
- Logical grouping of related components, hooks, and utilities
- Support for feature-specific business logic and state management
- Maintainable structure as the application grows in complexity

The codebase currently includes multiple feature domains:
- Authentication and user management
- Board and column management
- Task creation and editing
- Team collaboration and member management
- AI reporting and analytics
- Smart parameters and customization

Alternatives considered:
- Type-based structure (components/, hooks/, utils/): Poor feature cohesion
- Flat structure: Becomes unwieldy with growth
- Domain-driven design: Over-engineered for current team size

## Decision

We will organize code using a feature-based folder structure under `src/features/`.

Structure implementation:
```
src/
  features/
    auth/           # Authentication flows and user management
    board/          # Board creation, editing, and visualization
    task/           # Task management and editing
    team/           # Team collaboration and member management
    ai/             # AI reporting and analytics features
    account/        # User account and profile management
    issue/          # Issue tracking and resolution
    smart-params/   # Dynamic parameter configuration
    events/         # Event handling and notifications
    web-storage/    # Client-side storage management
  components/       # Shared UI components
  hooks/           # Shared custom hooks
  utils/           # Shared utilities and helpers
  core/            # Core business logic and services
```

Each feature contains its own components, hooks, and business logic specific to that domain.

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Developers can quickly locate all code related to a specific feature
- Feature teams can work independently with minimal file conflicts
- New features can be added with clear organizational patterns
- Business logic is co-located with its corresponding UI components
- Feature-specific testing and documentation is naturally organized
- Code reviews are more focused on specific business domains

### What becomes more difficult:
- Some code duplication across features may occur
- Shared functionality requires careful consideration of placement
- Cross-feature dependencies need explicit management
- Refactoring shared components affects multiple feature directories
- Initial learning curve for developers familiar with type-based organization
- Potential for feature boundaries to become unclear over time
