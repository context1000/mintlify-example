# Wouter Routing Library Choice

## Context

The Hotpot Tracker frontend requires client-side routing that supports:

- Clean URLs for boards, tasks, and team workspaces
- Programmatic navigation for task management workflows
- Route-based authentication and access control
- Lightweight bundle size for fast loading
- Simple integration with InstantDB's real-time data patterns

The application has several distinct routes:
- Landing pages (/ and /ru)
- Authentication flows (/auth)
- Workspace and team management (/workspace)
- Board listing and individual board views (/boards, /board/:id)
- Task detail views (/task/:id)
- Search and settings (/search, /settings)

Alternatives considered:
- React Router: Feature-rich but heavyweight for current needs
- Next.js Router: Requires full Next.js framework adoption
- Reach Router: Deprecated in favor of React Router
- Custom routing: High development overhead

## Decision

We will use Wouter as our client-side routing library.

Wouter provides:
- Minimal bundle size (~2KB) with essential routing features
- Hook-based API that integrates well with React patterns
- Clean programmatic navigation with `useLocation`
- Simple route matching and parameter extraction
- No complex configuration or setup required
- Perfect fit for single-page application needs

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Fast application loading with minimal routing overhead
- Simple route definitions using familiar React component patterns
- Programmatic navigation for task management workflows
- Easy integration with authentication and access control logic
- Straightforward parameter extraction for board and task IDs
- Lightweight solution that doesn't bloat the application bundle

### What becomes more difficult:
- Limited advanced routing features compared to React Router
- No built-in support for nested routing patterns
- Smaller community and ecosystem compared to mainstream alternatives
- Potential migration complexity if advanced routing needs emerge
- Limited documentation and learning resources
- Less sophisticated route matching and parameter handling capabilities
