# Chakra UI Design System Choice

## Context

The Hotpot Tracker frontend requires a comprehensive UI component library that supports:

- Rapid development of task management interfaces
- Consistent design language across boards, columns, and tasks
- Built-in accessibility features for collaborative environments
- Dark/light theme support for user preferences
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile collaboration
- Complex form components for task creation and editing

The team has strong React/TypeScript skills and needs a solution that integrates seamlessly with InstantDB's real-time updates while providing rich interactive components for collaborative task management.

Alternatives considered:
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size, complex customization for task-specific needs
- Ant Design: Business-focused but limited design flexibility
- Tailwind + Headless UI: More setup overhead, requires custom component development
- Custom CSS: High maintenance overhead, inconsistent design patterns

## Decision

We will use Chakra UI v3 as our primary design system and component library.

Chakra UI provides:
- Comprehensive component library with task management primitives (cards, modals, forms)
- Built-in theme system with easy dark/light mode switching
- Excellent TypeScript integration and developer experience
- Accessibility features out-of-the-box for collaborative interfaces
- Optimistic rendering support that works well with InstantDB's real-time updates
- Rich interaction components (drag-and-drop, modals, drawers) for board management

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Rapid UI development with pre-built, accessible components
- Consistent design patterns across all task management interfaces
- Built-in responsive design handling for different screen sizes
- Theme management and dark mode implementation requires minimal code
- Form handling and validation for task creation/editing workflows
- Drag-and-drop interactions for board columns and task management

### What becomes more difficult:
- Bundle size increase compared to minimal custom CSS solutions
- Learning curve for Chakra UI's specific patterns and styling approach
- Potential conflicts with custom styling needs for unique task visualization
- Dependency on third-party library for critical UI functionality
- Migration complexity if design requirements outgrow Chakra UI's capabilities
- Performance considerations with large numbers of task components
