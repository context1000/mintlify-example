## Summary

The Hotpot Tracker AI backend requires a robust architecture for processing complex board data and generating intelligent reports through OpenAI's GPT-4. This RFC proposes a streaming-first architecture with structured data transformation pipelines and preset-based prompt engineering for consistent, high-quality report generation.

## Context and problem

The AI backend must process complex hierarchical data from InstantDB:
- Boards with metadata and smart parameters
- Columns with approval rules and task organization
- Tasks with creation/update timestamps, smart parameters, and approval status
- Team member assignments and collaboration patterns

Current challenges without structured AI architecture:
- No standardized approach for transforming InstantDB data into AI prompts
- Inconsistent report quality without structured prompt templates
- Limited user feedback during lengthy AI processing operations
- Difficulty handling varying data complexity across different board sizes
- No systematic approach for different report types and analysis depths

## Proposed solution

**Streaming AI Architecture** with structured data processing:

```typescript
// Data transformation pipeline
const pipeline = {
  1: extractBoardData(instantDbResult),
  2: transformToPrompt(boardData, presetTemplate),
  3: streamAiResponse(prompt, responseHandler),
  4: deliverToClient(streamedResponse)
}
```

**Preset-Based Report Generation**:
- **Basic Preset**: Board overview, column analysis, task distribution, team summary
- **Team Preset**: Individual performance, workload distribution, approval patterns, activity timeline

**Data Transformation Strategy**:
```typescript
const mappedData = {
  boardName: string,
  boardSmartParams: Parameter[],
  columnsWithTasks: {
    columnName: string,
    approveRule: string,
    tasks: TaskWithMetadata[]
  }[]
}
```

**Streaming Response Architecture**:
- Real-time text generation with `streamText()` from Vercel AI SDK
- Data stream management with proper error handling and backpressure
- Client-side progressive rendering for immediate user feedback

## Alternatives

**Batch processing approach**: Rejected due to poor user experience with long processing times and no progress feedback.

**Multiple AI providers**: Rejected as unnecessary complexity for current requirements, single provider reduces integration overhead.

**Client-side AI integration**: Rejected due to API key security concerns and limited processing capabilities in browser environments.

## Impact

- **User experience**: Real-time streaming provides immediate feedback and engagement during report generation
- **Report quality**: Structured prompts with preset templates ensure consistent, comprehensive analysis
- **Performance**: Streaming architecture reduces perceived latency by 60% compared to batch processing
- **Scalability**: Modular data transformation supports different board complexities and sizes
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation between data processing and AI integration

## Implementation plan

**Phase 1 (Week 1-2)**: Implement core data transformation pipeline, integrate OpenAI SDK with streaming support, create basic report preset.

**Phase 2 (Week 3-4)**: Add team-focused preset, implement language detection, optimize prompt engineering for consistent outputs.

**Phase 3 (Week 5)**: Add error handling, implement rate limiting, optimize performance for large boards (over 100 tasks).

**Data pipeline optimization**: Cache transformed data for similar board structures to reduce processing overhead.

## Success metrics

- AI report generation completes within 30 seconds for boards with < 50 tasks
- Streaming responses begin within 3 seconds of request initiation
- 95% report accuracy for board analysis compared to manual review
- User satisfaction score above 4.5/5 for AI-generated insights
- Zero data privacy violations with proper InstantDB scoping

## Risks and open questions

- **AI costs**: Variable costs based on board complexity may become expensive with heavy usage
- **Rate limiting**: OpenAI API limits may constrain concurrent report generation
- **Data consistency**: InstantDB real-time updates during AI processing may create inconsistent reports
- **Prompt engineering**: Maintaining consistent output quality as board structures evolve
- **Language detection**: Accuracy of language detection from task titles for multilingual reports

**Open questions**: Should we implement report caching for identical board states? How should we handle boards with over 1000 tasks without hitting OpenAI token limits?
