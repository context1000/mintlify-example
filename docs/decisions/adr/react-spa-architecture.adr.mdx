# React SPA Architecture with Wouter Routing

## Context

Hotpot Tracker needs a modern, responsive frontend that provides:

- Fast, interactive user experience for task management
- Client-side routing for seamless navigation
- Real-time updates without page refreshes
- Mobile-responsive design for cross-platform use
- Integration with InstantDB's real-time capabilities

The team has strong React expertise and needs to deliver quickly while maintaining code quality. The application requires complex state management for real-time collaboration features.

Key considerations:
- Bundle size optimization for performance
- Developer experience and rapid iteration
- Component reusability and design consistency
- TypeScript integration throughout the stack

## Decision

We will build a React Single Page Application (SPA) using:

- **React 18** with hooks-based architecture for modern patterns
- **Wouter** for lightweight client-side routing (1.5KB vs 12KB+ React Router)
- **Chakra UI** for component library and design system
- **Vite** for development tooling and build optimization
- **TypeScript** for type safety and developer experience

This stack provides the right balance of performance, developer experience, and feature completeness for our collaborative task management use case.

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Fast development with pre-built, accessible UI components
- Excellent developer experience with Vite hot reload and TypeScript
- Small bundle size with Wouter routing improves load times
- Consistent visual design across application with Chakra UI theme
- Real-time state updates integrate seamlessly with React hooks
- Component testing and debugging with mature React ecosystem

### What becomes more difficult:
- SPA limitations for SEO and initial page load performance
- Client-side routing complexity for deep linking and browser history
- Dependency on Chakra UI design system limits custom styling flexibility
- No server-side rendering capabilities without additional setup
- JavaScript-heavy application may struggle on low-powered devices
- Complex state management across real-time collaborative features
