# InstantDB Backend Choice

## Context

Hotpot Tracker requires a real-time, collaborative backend solution that supports:

- Team-based task management with boards and columns
- Real-time updates for collaborative work environments  
- User authentication and team memberships
- Complex relational data structures
- Offline-first capabilities

The team has strong React/TypeScript skills but limited backend expertise. We need a solution that minimizes backend development while providing enterprise-grade features for collaborative task management.

Alternatives considered:
- Firebase: Limited relational capabilities, complex real-time queries
- Supabase: More setup overhead, requires managing PostgreSQL
- Custom Node.js API: High development and maintenance overhead

## Decision

We will use InstantDB as our primary backend-as-a-service (BaaS) solution.

InstantDB provides:
- Built-in real-time synchronization and multiplayer features
- Native support for complex entity relationships
- Schema-first approach with TypeScript integration
- Magic link authentication with minimal setup
- Optimistic updates and offline-first capabilities

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Rapid development with minimal backend code required
- Real-time collaboration features work out-of-the-box
- Schema evolution managed through structured migrations
- Strong TypeScript integration improves developer experience
- Authentication and user management handled automatically
- Offline functionality requires no additional implementation

### What becomes more difficult:
- Vendor lock-in to InstantDB ecosystem increases migration costs
- Less control over backend logic compared to custom solutions
- Potential scaling limitations with complex business logic
- Learning curve for InstantDB-specific patterns and limitations
- Limited customization options for advanced use cases
- Dependency on third-party service for critical application functionality
