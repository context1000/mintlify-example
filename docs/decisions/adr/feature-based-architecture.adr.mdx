# Feature-Based Code Organization

## Context

As Hotpot Tracker grows, we need a scalable code organization strategy that:

- Groups related functionality together for better cohesion
- Minimizes coupling between different business domains
- Makes it easy to locate and modify code across the application
- Supports team collaboration on different features simultaneously
- Facilitates feature-based development, testing, and deployment
- Enables potential feature extraction as separate packages

The team will grow and different developers need to work on different features without conflicts. The current flat structure in `src/` will become unwieldy as we add more components, hooks, and utilities.

Considerations:
- Clear boundaries between business domains
- Shared code identification and placement
- Cross-feature communication patterns
- Testing and development workflow impact

## Decision

We will organize code using a feature-based architecture with the following structure:

```
src/
├── features/          # Feature-specific code
│   ├── auth/         # Authentication flows
│   ├── board/        # Board management
│   ├── task/         # Task operations
│   ├── team/         # Team management
│   ├── account/      # User account settings
│   └── issue/        # Issue tracking
├── components/       # Shared UI components
├── hooks/           # Shared React hooks
├── utils/           # Shared utilities
├── pages/           # Page-level components
└── core/            # Core business logic
```

Each feature folder will contain all code specific to that business domain, while shared code goes in dedicated folders. Pages act as composition layers that combine features.

## Consequences

### What becomes easier:
- Clear mental model for where code belongs reduces cognitive load
- Reduced merge conflicts when teams work on different features
- Feature-based testing and development becomes straightforward
- Code ownership and responsibility boundaries are well-defined
- Refactoring within feature boundaries is simpler and safer
- Feature flagging and A/B testing implementation is more natural
- Potential extraction of features as separate packages or services

### What becomes more difficult:
- Initial overhead in deciding and maintaining feature boundaries
- Risk of code duplication if shared code isn't properly identified
- Cross-feature refactoring becomes more complex and coordinated
- Feature coupling can still occur through shared state or APIs
- New developers need to understand the organizational principles
- Shared utilities may become bloated without proper governance
