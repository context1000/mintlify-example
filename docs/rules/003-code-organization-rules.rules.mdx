# Code Organization Rules

## File and Folder Structure Rules

### MUST

- Use kebab-case for folder names
- Use PascalCase for component file names
- Use camelCase for utility file names
- Place feature-specific code in appropriate feature folders
- Use index.ts files to create clean public APIs
- Keep related files close together (colocation principle)

### MUST NOT

- Never mix naming conventions within the same codebase
- Never place feature-specific code in shared folders
- Never create circular dependencies between features

## Import/Export Rules

### MUST

- Use named exports for components and utilities
- Use default exports only for page components
- Group imports by source (external packages, internal modules, relative imports)
- Use absolute imports for shared code (`src/components/`, `src/utils/`)
- Use relative imports only for closely related files

### MUST NOT

- Never use wildcard imports (`import *`) except for React
- Never mix named and default exports in the same file
- Never create long import paths with many `../` segments

## Feature Boundaries Rules

### MUST

- Keep feature code self-contained within feature folders
- Use core layer for cross-feature business logic
- Expose feature APIs through index files
- Document feature dependencies clearly

### MUST NOT

- Never import directly from other feature folders
- Never create tight coupling between features
- Never bypass feature APIs by importing internal modules

## Shared Code Rules

### MUST

- Place truly shared components in `src/components/`
- Place shared utilities in `src/utils/`
- Place shared hooks in `src/hooks/`
- Create proper abstractions for shared functionality

### MUST NOT

- Never duplicate code across features without justification
- Never place feature-specific logic in shared folders
- Never create shared components with feature-specific knowledge

## Documentation Rules

### MUST

- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Document complex business logic
- Include usage examples for shared utilities
- Keep README files up to date

### MUST NOT

- Never leave TODO comments in production code
- Never document obvious functionality
- Never let documentation become outdated
